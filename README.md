#### *Notes*

- Some features are currently not available

    - Vibrate, alarm sound, alarm intents, alarm screen, etc.
    - Flutter does not support many of these features (or it was too difficult to implement)
    
- Only tested with Android
    
- Dark/Light mode only changes background for now, might update in the future (*might*)

- Might also add additional features and optimizations later
